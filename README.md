# Forum
This is a simple full stack application that functions as a forum. Features include user authentication, image upload, mailer. Built using Express, PostgreSQL(pg-promise), React. 

## Live version
It's coming after I finish the css with tailwind, implement better frontend state management with redux, fetching with with react query.
